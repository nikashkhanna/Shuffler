Party hosts give guests access to a universal playlist through a randomized code. Guests at the party 
can use a code to join and contribute to that playlist. Songs in the queue are voted upon by all the 
guests and the song with the most votes is played next. 

Our team began this project at CalHacks and we are currently in the process of finishing it. 
The team includes Nikash Khanna, Anish Nag, Abhishek Mahesh and Chetana Ramaiyer.
